In Objective-C, a tricky error can occur when dealing with `NSAutoreleasePool`.  If you create a pool within a loop and don't properly drain it each time, memory leaks can happen. The objects added to the pool won't be released until the pool itself is drained. This can lead to a gradual increase in memory consumption, especially if the loop runs many times or contains expensive operations.
